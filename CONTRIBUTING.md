# Contributing to slot-booking-system

Thank you for considering a contribution. Notes on the parts that are
easy to get wrong on a first pass:

## Development environment

The repository was scaffolded from
[project-template](https://github.com/P4suta/project-template). The
Day-1 layers in `.template/state.toml` show what hygiene tooling is
already wired up; check there before introducing new tooling.

```sh
just bootstrap    # mise install + lefthook install
just lint         # all configured lint passes
just test         # whatever the active language layers expose
```

`just hooks` installs the lefthook pre-commit / commit-msg / pre-push
hooks; anything that would fail in CI will fail locally first.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The
commit-msg hook enforces the type prefix; scope is optional. Allowed
types: `feat` / `fix` / `docs` / `style` / `refactor` / `perf` /
`test` / `build` / `ci` / `chore` / `revert`.

## Pull requests

* Branch off `main`, push, open a PR.
* Squash-merge by default. The PR title becomes the squashed commit
  message — write it as a Conventional Commit subject.
* CI must be green; reviewer approval required.
