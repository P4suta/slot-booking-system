# slot-booking-system

Slot booking system (early scaffold) — bootstrapped from P4suta/project-template

## Status

Generated from [project-template](https://github.com/P4suta/project-template).
The Day-1 hygiene layers (`core`, `typos`, `lefthook`,
`conventional-commits`, `dependabot-actions`, `adr-madr`) have been
applied. Pick the language overlay (`rust-workspace`,
`typescript-package`, …) that matches your project and run:

```sh
bash .template/bootstrap.sh --layers <chosen-layers>
```

## Development

```sh
just bootstrap    # mise install + lefthook install
just lint         # text-level lints (typos, actionlint, yamllint, markdownlint)
```

Language-specific recipes (build / test / coverage / audit) appear once
the matching language layer has been applied.
